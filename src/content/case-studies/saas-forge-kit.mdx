# Building SaaS Forge Kit: a production-ready Next.js SaaS blueprint

## Context

After building multiple web applications, I kept repeating the same groundwork: authentication, a database layer, a solid UI foundation, validation, and a clean project structure. Even when “copying from old projects”, the result was inconsistent and hard to maintain.

So I built **SaaS Forge Kit** as the starter I always wanted: a consistent, production-ready foundation you can **clone and extend**—for SaaS ideas, portfolios, and experiments.

## What the kit optimizes for

- **Developer experience & consistency**: predictable structure, conventions, and reusable patterns.
- **Type-safety end-to-end**: TypeScript + Zod + Prisma.
- **Deployability**: sane defaults for production, and a local setup that doesn’t waste time.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

**Framework: Next.js (App Router)**
- Modern routing/data fetching patterns
- Great performance and DX

**Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma**
- Type-safe queries and migrations
- Clean schema evolution

**UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**
- Minimal, consistent UI system
- Light/Dark mode ready

**Authentication: Better Auth**
- Email/password auth
- Optional Google OAuth

**Billing: Stripe (optional)**
- You can keep billing disabled by default
- Enable it only when the product needs it

**Local dev: Docker Compose**
- Start Postgres locally with one command
- Keeps onboarding simple

## Key Features

- Next.js + TypeScript baseline
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Zod validation
- Better Auth authentication flow
- Optional Stripe billing mode
- Responsive UI with theme support

## Tradeoffs

- The kit includes “optional” subsystems (like billing): you can keep them off, but the code is there when you want to scale the product.
- A blueprint requires conventions; I prefer that tradeoff to reduce ambiguity and speed up shipping.

## Next steps

- Portfolio template on top of SaaS Forge Kit (dynamic data + admin editor)
- More “recipes” (e.g., multi-tenant patterns, content/case-study modules)
- Better docs + examples for common use cases
